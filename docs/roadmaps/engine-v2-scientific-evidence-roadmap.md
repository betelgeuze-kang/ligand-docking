# Engine v2 scientific evidence roadmap

Status: planned evidence program; no scientific or product promotion

Observed baseline: `main@044638ef0cb058ca0946f69869a4fa04031ab903`

This roadmap separates implemented source contracts from future scientific,
benchmark, hardware, and product evidence. A green source-level test or CI job
does not satisfy a later stage and cannot promote a claim flag.

## Current claim boundary

The current repository state keeps all of the following false:

- `scientific_validation=false`
- `public_benchmark_validation=false`
- `gpu_parity=false`
- `customer_execution=false`
- `commercial_readiness=false`

The capability-level fields `claim_safe`, `scientifically_validated`,
`benchmark_validated`, and `customer_execution_enabled` also remain `false`.
Each stage below requires separately reviewed evidence; stages cannot be
collapsed or inferred from one another.

## Stage gates

| Stage | Required evidence | Explicit non-claim |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Contract correctness | Deterministic identities; serialization round trips; units and dimensions; failure-inclusive ledgers; finite-difference energy/force checks; invariance and fail-closed tests | Does not calibrate a force field or validate docking accuracy. |
| 2. Frozen public benchmark protocol | Versioned CASF/PDBBind-style protocol where licensing permits; split provenance; symmetry-aware RMSD; PoseBusters-style validity; failure-inclusive denominators; frozen manifest and executable/scorer fingerprints; predefined thresholds; no test-set tuning | Protocol readiness is not a successful benchmark result. |
| 3. External baseline receipts | Reviewed offline Vina/GNINA/Smina receipts; binary/version/container identity; exact case coverage; retained failures; input/output hashes; comparable score semantics | Receipt integrity is not public benchmark validation or endorsement of an external engine. |
| 4. Docking evidence | Pose success, scoring, ranking, and valid screening/enrichment metrics; uncertainty intervals; predefined acceptance thresholds; complete denominator | Passing one metric does not establish general docking accuracy or commercial fitness. |
| 5. Physics evidence | Reviewed parameter provenance and applicability domain; independent energy/force references; force validation before dynamics; dedicated protocol for any free-energy claim | Stable execution alone is not physical accuracy. |
| 6. GPU parity | CPU/GPU tolerance contract; deterministic fixtures; kernel-level and end-to-end comparisons; failures retained; performance measured separately | Throughput is not numerical correctness, and CPU tests do not imply GPU parity. |
| 7. Product qualification | Threat model; tenant isolation; artifact integrity; durable quota/rate state; rollback; operational evidence; explicit authorization review | Customer routes remain disabled until every required gate is accepted. |

## Evidence record requirements

Every stage artifact must record:

- immutable input and protocol identities;
- code, dependency, executable, and environment fingerprints appropriate to the
  stage;
- exact case coverage with failures retained in the denominator;
- units, score direction, aggregation, thresholds, and uncertainty method;
- artifact hashes and path-confinement verification;
- reviewer, timestamp, supersession, and revocation status;
- separate values for `implemented`, `scientifically_validated`,
  `benchmark_validated`, `customer_execution_enabled`, and `claim_safe`.

Missing, stale, partial, unsigned, or mismatched evidence must fail closed. A
stage artifact may reference an earlier accepted artifact but must not copy its
claim status without revalidating the dependency and freshness chain.

## Review and promotion rules

1. Define the protocol and acceptance thresholds before observing held-out
   results.
2. Keep training, validation, and test provenance explicit and prevent
   test-set tuning.
3. Review scientific evidence independently from API security and release CI.
4. Review GPU correctness independently from GPU performance.
5. Require a dedicated PR for every claim transition, with the exact evidence
   bundle and affected capability fields in scope.
6. Reject partial promotion: an implementation flag may become true without
   changing any scientific, benchmark, customer, or commercial claim.
7. Keep the customer execution path disabled until product qualification and
   explicit operator authorization are both accepted.

## Near-term work queue

- Continue V2-1 from current `main`: interpret selected `_atom_site.Cartn_x/y/z`
  as finite binary64 values while binding exact source spelling and keeping
  geometry quality, chemistry, and topology unassessed.
- Define the first executable supported-chemistry and preparation coverage table
  before starting production parameter fitting.
- Freeze a licensing-compatible public benchmark manifest and failure-inclusive
  reporting contract; do not run or publish a result as part of that protocol
  definition PR.
- Define independent parameter provenance and applicability-domain records for
  H5 reference physics before proposing any validation study.
- Design CPU/GPU parity fixtures only after the CPU reference behavior and
  tolerances are frozen.
- Close the remaining same-UID artifact TOCTOU, unsigned ledger, and runtime
  receipt re-evaluation risks before considering a customer-route review.

Until those evidence programs are executed and independently accepted, the
repository remains a bounded implementation and evidence-verification
scaffold, not a scientifically validated or commercially ready platform.
