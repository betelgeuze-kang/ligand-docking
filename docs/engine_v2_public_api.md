# Engine v2 Public API Stability Policy

The independent distribution is named `betelgeuze-engine-v2`. Distribution,
engine API, molecular schema, runtime-input, checkpoint, and result versions are
separate contracts; see `betelgeuze_engine_v2.contracts.schema.VERSION_TAXONOMY`.

## Stability tiers

### Stable within an Engine API major version

Symbols explicitly exported from `betelgeuze_engine_v2.__all__` are the stable
root API. Compatible additions may occur in a minor release. Removal or an
incompatible signature/semantic change requires an Engine API major-version
change.

Stable root surfaces currently cover:

- all-atom state and validation contracts;
- canonical system/topology/coordinate hashes;
- bounded sparse-neighbor contracts;
- deterministic atom features;
- scalar-energy/force reference primitives;
- projection and energy-composition contracts;
- the fail-closed CPU reference orchestrator;
- version and quantity descriptors.

### Provisional submodule APIs

The following V2-K modules are intentionally importable but provisional:

```text
betelgeuze_engine_v2.io
betelgeuze_engine_v2.molecular.mmcif_*
betelgeuze_engine_v2.docking
betelgeuze_engine_v2.benchmark
betelgeuze_engine_v2.physics.registry
betelgeuze_engine_v2.physics.reference_parameter_applicability
betelgeuze_engine_v2.runtime
```

The frozen public-benchmark protocol symbols under
`betelgeuze_engine_v2.benchmark` define input identities, endpoint rules, and a
failure-inclusive reporting contract only. They do not authorize data fetch,
benchmark execution, result publication, or scientific promotion.

The frozen H5 reference-parameter applicability symbols under
`betelgeuze_engine_v2.physics` record caller-supplied parameter origin, exact
implemented equations, code-enforced execution admission, capacity defaults,
and bound source hashes. They do not ship or assign a parameter set, parse the
reviewed Sage artifact, establish chemical applicability, authorize fitting or
validation, or enable a customer/runtime physics route.

Their schema IDs and serialized receipts are versioned, but Python convenience
signatures may change before the distribution reaches `1.0.0`. Callers should
pin the distribution version and validate schema IDs.

### Internal APIs

Names beginning with `_`, implementation files not re-exported from a package
`__init__`, and test helpers are internal. They carry no compatibility promise.

## Scientific semantics

API stability never upgrades scientific status. A stable API may still return
an uncalibrated internal scalar or a claim-blocked result. Consumers must inspect
quantity descriptors, capability rows, blockers, and provenance rather than
inferring scientific validity from import stability.

## Deprecation policy

Before `1.0.0`, a provisional submodule change should include:

- a changelog entry;
- a schema/version decision;
- a migration note when serialized data changes;
- focused compatibility tests.

Stable root API removal requires a major Engine API version change. A deprecated
alias should remain for at least one minor release when practical and must not
silently change scientific meaning.
